# diceapp

## About
A small dynamic web application that simulates a OS with two applications, diceapp and clockapp. This application was developed for an assignment in a course at Linnaeus university in late 2018/early 2019. The purpose was to learn how to construct dynamic web applications that are not dependent or locked to a predefined HTML structure.

The assignment involved only the creation of functionality with JavaScript. Image files, css, wav and DragnDrop.js are by courtesy of [Henrik Andersen](https://github.com/VectorPanic).
